<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;And do you bring such a message to me,&rdquo; exclaimed Judith, though the tone in which the words were uttered had more in it of sorrow than of anger. &ldquo;Am I a girl to be an Indian's slave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you wish my honest thoughts on this p'int, Judith, I shall answer that I don't think you'll, willingly, ever become any man's slave; red-skin or white. You're not to think hard, howsever, of my bringing the message, as near as I could, in the very words in which it was given to me. Them was the conditions on which I got my furlough, and a bargain is a bargain, though it is made with a vagabond. I've told you what they've said, but I've not yet told you what I think you ought, one and all, to answer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
