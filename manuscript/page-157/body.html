<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;But you've got a name&mdash;you don't throw away one name, before you come honestly by another?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope not, gal&mdash;I hope not. My names have come nat'rally, and I suppose the one I bear now will be of no great lasting, since the Delawares seldom settle on a man's ra'al title, until such time as he has an opportunity of showing his true natur', in the council, or on the warpath; which has never behappened me; seeing firstly, because I'm not born a red-skin and have no right to sit in their councillings, and am much too humble to be called on for opinions from the great of my own colour; and, secondly, because this is the first war that has befallen in my time, and no inimy has yet inroaded far enough into the colony, to be reached by an arm even longer than mine.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
