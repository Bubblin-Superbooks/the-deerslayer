She was not made Through years or moons the inner weight to bear, Which colder hearts endure till they are laid By age in earth; her days and pleasure were Brief but delightful&mdash;such as had not stayed Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well By the sea-shore whereon she loved to dwell.&rdquo; Byron. Don Juan, IV, lxxi.</p><p>The young men who had been sent out to reconnoitre, on the sudden appearance of Hetty, soon returned to report their want of success in making any discovery. One of them had even been along the beach as far as the spot opposite to the ark, but the darkness had completely concealed that vessel from his notice. Others had examined in different directions, and everywhere the stillness of night was added to the silence and solitude of the woods.</p></div> </div>
