<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Why, Deerslayer, I've got to believe that a man meets with inimies easier than he meets with fri'nds. It's skearful to think for how many causes one gets to be your inimy, and for how few your fri'nd. Some take up the hatchet because you don't think just as they think; other some because you run ahead of 'em in the same idees; and I once know'd a vagabond that quarrelled with a fri'nd because he didn't think him handsome. Now, you're no monument in the way of beauty, yourself, Deerslayer, and yet you wouldn't be so onreasonable as to become my inimy for just saying so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm as the Lord made me; and I wish to be accounted no better, nor any worse.</p></div> </div>
