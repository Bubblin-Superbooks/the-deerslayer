I will come and see them again, if they wish me to, and read more out of the Bible to them, but I can't quit father's and mother's graves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do&mdash;that will do, Hetty, just as well as if you sent them a message twice as long,&rdquo; interrupted the hunter. &ldquo;I'll tell 'em all you've said, and all you mean, and I'll answer for it that they'll be easily satisfied. Now, Judith, your turn comes next, and then this part of my ar'n'd will be tarminated for the night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
