Hetty gazed at her in wonder; but naturally supposing her own situation was the cause of this grief, she kindly offered to console her sister.</p><p>&ldquo;Don't mind me, dear Judith,&rdquo; said the affectionate and pure-hearted creature, &ldquo;I don't suffer; if I do die, why father and mother are both dead, and what happens to them may well happen to me. You know I am of less account than any of the family; therefore few will think of me after I'm in the lake.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
