<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Howsever, I am not ag'in the opinion now, for you must know, Sarpent, that the great principle of Christianity is to believe without seeing, and a man should always act up to his religion and principles, let them be what they may.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is strange for a wise nation!&rdquo; said the Delaware with emphasis. &ldquo;The red man looks hard, that he may see and understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that's plauserble, and is agreeable to mortal pride, but it's not as deep as it seems. If we could understand all we see, Sarpent, there might be not only sense, but safety, in refusin' to give faith to any one thing that we might find oncomperhensible; but when there's so many things about which it may be said we know nothin' at all, why, there's little use, and no reason, in bein' difficult touchin' any one in partic'lar.</p></div> </div>
