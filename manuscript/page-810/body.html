Is it enough? or, must I, while a thrill Lives in your sapient bosoms, cheat you still?&rdquo; Thomas Moore, Lalla Rookh, &ldquo;The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan&rdquo;</p><p>The fire, the canoe, and the spring, near which Deerslayer commenced his retreat, would have stood in the angles of a triangle of tolerably equal sides. The distance from the fire to the boat was a little less than the distance from the fire to the spring, while the distance from the spring to the boat was about equal to that between the two points first named. This, however, was in straight lines, a means of escape to which the fugitives could not resort. They were obliged to have recourse to a detour in order to get the cover of the bushes, and to follow the curvature of the beach.</p></div> </div>
