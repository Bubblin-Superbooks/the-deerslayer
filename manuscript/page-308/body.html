<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian; &ldquo;my brother missionary&mdash;great talk; all about Manitou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so&mdash;not so, warrior. I'm not good enough for the Moravians, and am too good for most of the other vagabonds that preach about in the woods. No, no; I'm only a hunter, as yet, though afore the peace is made, 'tis like enough there'll be occasion to strike a blow at some of your people. Still, I wish it to be done in fair fight, and not in a quarrel about the ownership of a miserable canoe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good! My brother very young&mdash;but he is very wise. Little warrior&mdash;great talker. Chief, sometimes, in council.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
