Perhaps when I'm dead, God will give me all my mind, and I shall become a more fitting companion for mother than I ever was before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be an angel in heaven, Hetty,&rdquo; sobbed the sister; &ldquo;no spirit there will be more worthy of its holy residence!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand it quite; still, I know it must be all true; I've read it in the Bible. How dark it's becoming! Can it be night so soon? I can hardly see you at all&mdash;where is Hist?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
