<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sartain, Judith; few convarse better than yourself, and none more agreeable, like. Your words are as pleasant as your looks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is the manner in which you have so often praised those looks, that gives me courage to proceed. Still, Deerslayer, it is not easy for one of my sex and years to forget all her lessons of infancy, all her habits, and her natural diffidence, and say openly what her heart feels!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, Judith? Why shouldn't women as well as men deal fairly and honestly by their fellow creatur's? I see no reason why you should not speak as plainly as myself, when there is any thing ra'ally important to be said.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
