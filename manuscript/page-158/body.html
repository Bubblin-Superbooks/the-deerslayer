<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Tell me your names,&rdquo; added Hetty, looking up at him artlessly, &ldquo;and, maybe, I'll tell you your character.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is some truth in that, I'll not deny, though it often fails. Men are deceived in other men's characters, and frequently give 'em names they by no means desarve. You can see the truth of this in the Mingo names, which, in their own tongue, signify the same things as the Delaware names,&mdash;at least, so they tell me, for I know little of that tribe, unless it be by report,&mdash;and no one can say they are as honest or as upright a nation. I put no great dependence, therefore, on names.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
