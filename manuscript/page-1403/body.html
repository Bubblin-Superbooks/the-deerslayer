<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The pale-face cur begins to put his tail between his legs!&rdquo; cried a young and garrulous savage, who bore the appropriate title of the Corbeau Rouge; a sobriquet he had gained from the French by his facility in making unseasonable noises, and an undue tendency to hear his own voice; &ldquo;he is no warrior; he has killed the Loup Cervier when looking behind him not to see the flash of his own rifle. He grunts like a hog, already; when the Huron women begin to torment him, he will cry like the young of the catamount. He is a Delaware woman, dressed in the skin of a Yengeese!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have your say, young man; have your say,&rdquo; returned Deerslayer, unmoved; &ldquo;you know no better, and I can overlook it. Talking may aggravate women, but can hardly make knives sharper, fire hotter, or rifles more sartain.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
