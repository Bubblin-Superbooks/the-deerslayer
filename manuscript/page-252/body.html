The place was found in the quiet of midnight, a sort of type of the solitude of a wilderness. As an enemy was known to be near, Hutter directed his daughters to abstain from the use of lights, luxuries in which they seldom indulged during the warm months, lest they might prove beacons to direct their foes where they might be found.</p><p>&ldquo;In open daylight I shouldn't fear a host of savages behind these stout logs, and they without any cover to skulk into,&rdquo; added Hutter, when he had explained to his guests the reasons why he forbade the use of light; &ldquo;for I've three or four trusty weapons always loaded, and Killdeer, in particular, is a piece that never misses. But it's a different thing at night.</p></div> </div>
