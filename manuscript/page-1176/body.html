A girl may be excused, who reads about her own father and mother, and that too for the first time in her life! I am sorry to have kept you waiting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind me, gal; never mind me. It matters little whether I sleep or watch; but though you be pleasant to look at, and are so handsome, Judith, it is not altogether agreeable to sit so long to behold you shedding tears. I know that tears don't kill, and that some people are better for shedding a few now and then, especially young women; but I'd rather see you smile any time, Judith, than see you weep.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
