<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Poor Hetty! They are happily removed beyond all cares on our account. Nothing that I can do or say will cause mother any sorrow now&mdash;there is some consolation in that, at least! And nothing you can say or do will make her smile, as she used to smile on your good conduct when living.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don't know that, Judith. Spirits can see, and mother may see as well as any spirit. She always told us that God saw all we did, and that we should do nothing to offend him; and now she has left us, I strive to do nothing that can displease her. Think how her spirit would mourn and feel sorrow, Judith, did it see either of us doing what is not right; and spirits may see, after all; especially the spirits of parents that feel anxious about their children.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
