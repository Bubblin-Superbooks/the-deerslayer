<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Judith demanded of the young man, as they stood near each other, Deerslayer holding the steering-oar, and she working with a needle at some ornament of dress, that much exceeded her station in life, and was altogether a novelty in the woods. &ldquo;Will a few minutes, sooner or later, alter the matter? It will be very hazardous to remain long as near the shore as that rock!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's it, Judith; that's the very difficulty! The rock's within p'int blank for a shot-gun, and 'twill never do to hover about it too close and too long. When you have to deal with an Injin, you must calculate and manage, for a red natur' dearly likes sarcumvention. Now you see, Judith, that I do not steer towards the rock at all, but here to the eastward of it, whereby the savages will be tramping off in that direction, and get their legs a-wearied, and all for no advantage.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
