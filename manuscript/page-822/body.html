<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Your own people will not own you, and no tribe of redmen would have you in their wigwams; you skulk among petticoated warriors. You slay our brave friend who has left us?&mdash;No&mdash;his great soul scorned to fight you, and left his body rather than have the shame of slaying you! But the blood that you spilt when the spirit was not looking on, has not sunk into the ground. It must be buried in your groans. What music do I hear? Those are not the wailings of a red man!&mdash;no red warrior groans so much like a hog. They come from a pale-face throat&mdash;a Yengeese bosom, and sound as pleasant as girls singing&mdash;Dog&mdash;skunk&mdash;woodchuck-mink&mdash;hedgehog&mdash;pig&mdash;toad&mdash;spider&mdash;yengee&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
