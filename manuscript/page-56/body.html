<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Look this-a-way, Hurry&mdash;here, in a line with the black oak&mdash;don't you see the crooked sapling that is hooked up in the branches of the bass-wood, near it? Now, that sapling was once snow-ridden, and got the bend by its weight; but it never straightened itself, and fastened itself in among the bass-wood branches in the way you see. The hand of man did that act of kindness for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That hand was mine!&rdquo; exclaimed Hurry; &ldquo;I found the slender young thing bent to the airth, like an unfortunate creatur' borne down by misfortune, and stuck it up where you see it. After all, Deerslayer, I must allow, you're getting to have an oncommon good eye for the woods!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
