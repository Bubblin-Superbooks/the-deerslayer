Hurry's legs were just released, and he had been placed on his feet. So tightly had the ligatures been drawn, that the use of his limbs was not immediately recovered, and the young giant presented, in good sooth, a very helpless and a somewhat ludicrous picture. It was this unusual spectacle, particularly the bewildered countenance, that excited the merriment of Deerslayer.</p><p>&ldquo;You look like a girdled pine in a clearin', Hurry Harry, that is rocking in a gale,&rdquo; said Deerslayer, checking his unseasonable mirth, more from delicacy to the others than from any respect to the liberated captive. &ldquo;I'm glad, howsever, to see that you haven't had your hair dressed by any of the Iroquois barbers, in your late visit to their camp.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
