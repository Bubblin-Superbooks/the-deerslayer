Hurry is a man I could never marry, though he were ten times more comely to the eye, and a hundred times more stout of heart than he really is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not, Judith, why not? I own I'm cur'ous to know why a youth like Hurry shouldn't find favor with a maiden like you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you shall know, Deerslayer,&rdquo; returned the girl, gladly availing herself of the opportunity of indirectly extolling the qualities which had so strongly interested her in her listener; hoping by these means covertly to approach the subject nearest her heart. &ldquo;In the first place, looks in a man are of no importance with a woman, provided he is manly, and not disfigured, or deformed.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
