I'm your prisoner ag'in, and I hope you'll allow that I'm as good at breaking gaol, as I am at keeping furloughs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My young friend is a Moose!&rdquo; exclaimed the Huron. &ldquo;His legs are very long; they have given my young men trouble. But he is not a fish; he cannot find his way in the lake. We did not shoot him; fish are taken in nets, and not killed by bullets. When he turns Moose again he will be treated like a Moose.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
