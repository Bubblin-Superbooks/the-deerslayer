But this is an uncommon business in more ways than one, Judith. I hear your father and Hurry growling like bears, and yet no noise comes from the mouth of the young chief. There's an ind of secrecy, and yet his whoop, which ought to ring in the mountains, accordin' to rule in such sarcumstances, is silent!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Justice may have alighted on him, and his death have saved the lives of the innocent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not it&mdash;not it&mdash;the Sarpent is not the one to suffer if that's to be the law. Sartainly there has been no onset, and 'tis most likely that the camp's deserted, and the men are comin' back disapp'inted. That accounts for the growls of Hurry and the silence of the Sarpent.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
