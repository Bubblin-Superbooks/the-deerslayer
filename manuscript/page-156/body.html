<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I'm Hetty Hutter&rdquo; returned the girl in a low, sweet voice, which nature, aided by some education, had preserved from vulgarity of tone and utterance&mdash;&ldquo;I'm Hetty; Judith Hutter's sister; and Thomas Hutter's youngest daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know your history, then, for Hurry Harry talks considerable, and he is free of speech when he can find other people's consarns to dwell on. You pass most of your life on the lake, Hetty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly. Mother is dead; father is gone a-trapping, and Judith and I stay at home. What's your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's a question more easily asked than it is answered, young woman, seeing that I'm so young, and yet have borne more names than some of the greatest chiefs in all America.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
