<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What should we gain, Master Hutter, by changing the position?&rdquo; asked Deerslayer, with a good deal of earnestness; &ldquo;this is a safe cover, and a stout defence might be made from the inside of this cabin. I've never fou't unless in the way of tradition; but it seems to me we might beat off twenty Mingos, with palisades like them afore us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; you 've never fought except in traditions, that's plain enough, young man! Did you ever see as broad a sheet of water as this above us, before you came in upon it with Hurry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can't say that I ever did,&rdquo; Deerslayer answered, modestly. &ldquo;Youth is the time to l'arn; and I'm far from wishing to raise my voice in counsel, afore it is justified by exper'ence.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
