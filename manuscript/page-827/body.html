But if you wish to get any thing out of me, speak plainer, for bargains can not be made blindfolded, or tongue tied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good; Hawkeye has not a forked tongue, and he likes to say what he thinks. He is an acquaintance of the Muskrat,&rdquo; this was the name by which all the Indians designated Hutter&mdash;&ldquo;and has lived in his wigwam. But he is not a friend. He wants no scalps, like a miserable Indian, but fights like a stout-hearted pale-face. The Muskrat is neither white, nor red. Neither a beast nor a fish. He is a water snake; sometimes in the spring and sometimes on the land. He looks for scalps, like an outcast.</p></div> </div>
