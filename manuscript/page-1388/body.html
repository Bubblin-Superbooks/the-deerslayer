They tell me you have now slain the woman's husband and brother!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It's true, my good Hetty&mdash;'tis gospel truth, and I'll not deny what has come to pass. But, you must remember, gal, that many things are lawful in war, which would be onlawful in peace. The husband was shot in open fight&mdash;or, open so far as I was consarned, while he had a better cover than common&mdash;and the brother brought his end on himself, by casting his tomahawk at an unarmed prisoner. Did you witness that deed, gal?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
