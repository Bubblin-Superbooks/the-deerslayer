Wigwam full, and scalps sell high. Small scalp, much gold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well that explains it&mdash;yes, that does explain it. There's no need of being any plainer. Now you know, lad, that the oldest of your prisoners is the father of these two young women, and the other is the suitor of one of them. The gals nat'rally wish to save the scalps of such fri'nds, and they will give them two ivory creaturs, as ransom. One for each scalp. Go back and tell this to your chiefs, and bring me the answer before the sun sets.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
