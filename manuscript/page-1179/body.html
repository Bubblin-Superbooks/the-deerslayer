<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What reason can there be, if Hetty and I are willing to part with the trifles for your sake, and the savages are willing to receive them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's it, Judith; you've got the idees, but they're a little out of their places, as if a hound should take the back'ard instead of the leading scent. That the Mingos will be willing to receive them things, or any more like 'em you may have to offer is probable enough, but whether they'll pay valie for 'em is quite another matter. Ask yourself, Judith, if any one should send you a message to say that, for such or such a price, you and Hetty might have that chist and all it holds, whether you'd think it worth your while to waste many words on the bargain?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
