<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is white neglect,&rdquo; said Deerslayer, shaking his head, &ldquo;and scarce a season goes by that some one in the settlements doesn't suffer from it. It's extr'ornary too, Judith&mdash;yes, it's downright extr'ornary that the owner shall fire his piece at a deer, or some other game, or perhaps at an inimy, and twice out of three times he'll miss; but let him catch an accident with one of these forgotten charges, and he makes it sartain death to a child, or a brother, or a fri'nd! Well, we shall do a good turn to the owner if we fire these pistols for him, and as they're novelties to you and me, Sarpent, we'll try our hands at a mark. Freshen that priming, and I'll do the same with this, and then we'll see who is the best man with a pistol; as for the rifle, that's long been settled atween us.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
