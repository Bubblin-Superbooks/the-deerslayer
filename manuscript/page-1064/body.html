<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Harry March loves you, sister,&rdquo; returned poor Hetty, unconsciously picking the bark off the canoe as she spoke. &ldquo;He would be glad to be your husband, I'm sure, and a stouter and a braver youth is not to be met with the whole country round.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Harry March and I understand each other, and no more need be said about him. There is one&mdash;but no matter. It is all in the hands of providence, and we must shortly come to some conclusion about our future manner of living. Remain here&mdash;that is, remain here, alone, we cannot&mdash;and perhaps no occasion will ever offer for remaining in the manner you think of. It is time, too, Hetty, we should learn all we can concerning our relations and family. It is not probable we are altogether without relations, and they may be glad to see us.</p></div> </div>
