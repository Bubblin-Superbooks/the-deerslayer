Mother had many such burdens, she used to tell me, and she always took them off in this way. 'Tis the only way, sister, such things can be done. You may raise a stone, or a log, with your hands; but the heart must be lightened by prayer. I don't think you pray as often as you used to do, when younger, Judith!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;never mind, child,&rdquo; answered the other huskily, &ldquo;'tis no matter, now. Mother is gone, and Thomas Hutter is gone, and the time has come when we must think and act for ourselves.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
