Father's in the lake, and so is mother, and we should all fear God, for we don't know when we may be in the lake, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sounds reasonable, child, as does most you say. Well, if we ever meet ag'in, Hetty, you'll find a fri'nd in me, let your sister do what she may. I was no great fri'nd of your mother I'll allow, for we didn't think alike on most p'ints, but then your father, Old Tom, and I, fitted each other as remarkably as a buckskin garment will fit any reasonable-built man.</p></div> </div>
