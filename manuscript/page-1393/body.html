<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ay, gal, you ain't Sumach, but a comely young Christian, with a good heart, pleasant smile, and kind eye. Hurry might be proud to get you, and that, too, not in misery and sorrow, but in his best and happiest days. Howsever, take my advice, and never talk to Hurry about these things; he's only a borderer, at the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn't tell him, for the world!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, looking about her like one affrighted, and blushing, she knew not why. &ldquo;Mother always said young women shouldn't be forward, and speak their minds before they're asked; Oh! I never forget what mother told me. 'Tis a pity Hurry is so handsome, Deerslayer; I do think fewer girls would like him then, and he would sooner know his own mind.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
