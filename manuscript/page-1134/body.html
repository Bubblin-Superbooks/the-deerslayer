I can only say that their faces look a little dark upon me, but it doesn't thunder every time a black cloud rises, nor does every puff of wind blow up rain. That's a question, therefore, much more easily put than answered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So is this message of the Iroquois to me,&rdquo; answered Judith rising, as if she had determined on her own course for the present. &ldquo;My answer shall be given, Deerslayer, after you and I have talked together alone, when the others have laid themselves down for the night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
