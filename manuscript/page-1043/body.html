<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have observed both, and have thought the last remarkable for a man of Harry March's decision and fearlessness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There's been a reason, gal, and it's one that troubles me even now&mdash;nay, don't flush up so, and look fiery like, for there are thoughts which will stick long in any man's mind, as there be words that will stick in his throat&mdash;but, then ag'in, there's feelin's that will get the better of 'em all, and to these feelin's I find I must submit. You've no longer a father, or a mother, Judith, and it's morally unpossible that you and Hetty could live here, alone, allowing it was peace and the Iroquois was quiet; but, as matters stand, not only would you starve, but you'd both be prisoners, or scalped, afore a week was out. It's time to think of a change and a husband, and, if you'll accept of me, all that's past shall be forgotten, and there's an end on't.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
