I may say one Mingo fell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A chief!&rdquo; demanded the other with startling vehemence.</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, that's more than I know, or can say. He was artful, and treacherous, and stout-hearted, and may well have gained popularity enough with his people to be named to that rank. The man fou't well, though his eye was'n't quick enough for one who had had his schooling in your company, Delaware.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My brother and friend struck the body?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was uncalled for, seeing that the Mingo died in my arms. The truth may as well be said, at once; he fou't like a man of red gifts, and I fou't like a man with gifts of my own colour. God gave me the victory; I coul'n't fly in the face of his Providence by forgetting my birth and natur'. White he made me, and white I shall live and die.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
