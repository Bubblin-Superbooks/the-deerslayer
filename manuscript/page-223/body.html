'Do as you would be done by,' they tell me, is the true saying, while men practyse the false. They think all the colonies wrong that offer bounties for scalps, and believe no blessing will follow the measures. Above all things, they forbid revenge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That for your Moravians!&rdquo; cried March, snapping his fingers; &ldquo;they're the next thing to Quakers; and if you'd believe all they tell you, not even a 'rat would be skinned, out of marcy.
