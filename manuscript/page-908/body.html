What you t'ink Manitou say? What you t'ink Manitou feel? What Iroquois do? No get honour&mdash;no get camp&mdash;no get prisoner&mdash;no get battle&mdash;no get scalp&mdash;no get not'ing at all! Blood come after blood! How you feel, your wife killed? Who pity you, when tear come for moder, or sister? You big as great pine&mdash;Huron gal little slender birch&mdash;why you fall on her and crush her? You t'ink Huron forget it? No; red-skin never forget! Never forget friend; never forget enemy. Red man Manitou in dat. Why you so wicked, great pale-face?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
