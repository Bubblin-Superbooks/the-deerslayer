<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;With a furlough, gal; that's a thong that binds tighter than any chain. One may be broken, but the other can't. Ropes and chains allow of knives, and desait, and contrivances; but a furlough can be neither cut, slipped nor sarcumvented.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What sort of a thing is a furlough, then, if it be stronger than hemp or iron? I never saw a furlough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope you may never feel one, gal; the tie is altogether in the feelin's, in these matters, and therefore is to be felt and not seen. You can understand what it is to give a promise, I dare to say, good little Hetty?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
