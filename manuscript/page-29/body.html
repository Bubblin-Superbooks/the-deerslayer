<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Then he was wrong, Hurry; very wrong. A man can enjoy plunder peaceably nowhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's much as his turn of mind may happen to be. I've known them that never could enjoy it at all, unless it was in the midst of a jollification, and them again that enjoyed it best in a corner. Some men have no peace if they don't find plunder, and some if they do. Human nature' is crooked in these matters. Old Tom seems to belong to neither set, as he enjoys his, if plunder he has really got, with his darters, in a very quiet and comfortable way, and wishes for no more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, he has darters, too; I've heard the Delawares, who've hunted this a way, tell their histories of these young women. Is there no mother, Hurry?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
