<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is my betrothed; that pale-face is my friend. My heart was heavy, when I missed him; I followed him to your camp, to see that no harm happened to him. All the Delaware girls are waiting for Wah; they wonder that she stays away so long. Come, let us say farewell, and go on our path.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hurons, this is your mortal enemy, the Great Serpent of them you hate!&rdquo; cried Briarthorn. &ldquo;If he escape, blood will be in your moccasin prints, from this spot to the Canadas. I am all Huron!&rdquo; As the last words were uttered, the traitor cast his knife at the naked breast of the Delaware. A quick movement of the arm, on the part of Hist, who stood near, turned aside the blow, the dangerous weapon burying its point in a pine. At the next instant, a similar weapon glanced from the hand of the Serpent, and quivered in the recreant's heart.</p></div> </div>
