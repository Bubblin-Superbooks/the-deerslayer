Hawkeye has stolen my wife; he must bring her back, or his scalp will hang on a pole, and dry in my wigwam.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hawkeye has stolen nothing, Huron. He doesn't come of a thieving breed, nor has he thieving gifts. Your wife, as you call Wah-ta-Wah, will never be the wife of any red-skin of the Canadas; her mind is in the cabin of a Delaware, and her body has gone to find it. The catamount is actyve I know, but its legs can't keep pace with a woman's wishes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
