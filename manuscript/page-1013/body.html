Hetty, isn't there something in the Bible about cooling the tongue of a man who was burning in Hell fire?&rdquo;</p><p>Judith turned away shocked, but Hetty eagerly sought the passage, which she read aloud to the conscience stricken victim of his own avaricious longings.</p><p>&ldquo;That's it, poor Hetty; yes, that's it. My tongue wants cooling, now&mdash;what will it be hereafter?&rdquo;</p><p>This appeal silenced even the confiding Hetty, for she had no answer ready for a confession so fraught with despair. Water, so long as it could relieve the sufferer, it was in the power of the sisters to give, and from time to time it was offered to the lips of the sufferer as he asked for it. Even Judith prayed.</p></div> </div>
