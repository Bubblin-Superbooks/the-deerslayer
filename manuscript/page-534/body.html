<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Not so&mdash;not so&mdash;&rdquo; answered Hetty earnestly, when these words had been interpreted&mdash;&ldquo;There is not a word about rifles in the whole book, and powder and bullets give offence to the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why then does the pale-face use them? If he is ordered to give double to him that asks only for one thing, why does he take double from the poor Indian who ask for no thing. He comes from beyond the rising sun, with this book in his hand, and he teaches the red man to read it, but why does he forget himself all it says? When the Indian gives, he is never satisfied; and now he offers gold for the scalps of our women and children, though he calls us beasts if we take the scalp of a warrior killed in open war. My name is Rivenoak.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
