<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>you are a little weak minded, it must be allowed, but you know something of Injins. Here I am in their hands, after having slain one of their stoutest warriors, and they've been endivouring to work upon me through fear of consequences, to betray your father, and all in the Ark. I understand the blackguards as well as if they'd told it all out plainly, with their tongues. They hold up avarice afore me, on one side, and fear on t'other, and think honesty will give way atween 'em both. But let your father and Hurry know, 'tis all useless; as for the Sarpent, he knows it already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what shall I tell Judith? She will certainly send me back, if I don't satisfy her mind.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
