<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this bay Hurry felt almost certain of finding the ark, since, anchored behind the trees that covered the narrow strip of the point, it might have lain concealed from prying eyes an entire summer. So complete, indeed, was the cover, in this spot, that a boat hauled close to the beach, within the point, and near the bottom of the bay, could by any possibility be seen from only one direction; and that was from a densely wooded shore within the sweep of the water, where strangers would be little apt to go.</p><p>&ldquo;We shall soon see the ark,&rdquo; said Hurry, as the canoe glided round the extremity of the point, where the water was so deep as actually to appear black; &ldquo;he loves to burrow up among the rushes, and we shall be in his nest in five minutes, although the old fellow may be off among the traps himself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
