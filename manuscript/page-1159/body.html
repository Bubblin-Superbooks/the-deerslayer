So take your seat, raise the lid of the chest, and this time we will go to the bottom. I shall be disappointed if something is not found to tell us more of the history of Thomas Hutter and my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why Thomas Hutter, Judith, and not your father? The dead ought to meet with as much reverence as the living!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have long suspected that Thomas Hutter was not my father, though I did think he might have been Hetty's, but now we know he was the father of neither. He acknowledged that much in his dying moments. I am old enough to remember better things than we have seen on this lake, though they are so faintly impressed on my memory that the earlier part of my life seems like a dream.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
