<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Tisn't right, Judith, for children to talk of their parents' sins. We had better talk of our own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Talk of your sins, Hetty!&mdash;If there ever was a creature on earth without sin, it is you! I wish I could say, or think the same of myself; but we shall see. No one knows what changes affection for a good husband can make in a woman's heart. I don't think, child, I have even now the same love for finery I once had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It would be a pity, Judith, if you did think of clothes, over your parents' graves! We will never quit this spot, if you say so, and will let Hurry go where he pleases.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
