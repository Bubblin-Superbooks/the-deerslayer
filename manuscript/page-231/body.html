<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That's not it, father! Don't kill them, nor let them kill us. Sell your skins, and get more, if you can; but don't sell human blood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, come, child; let us talk of matters you understand. Are you glad to see our old friend, March, back again? You like Hurry, and must know that one day he may be your brother&mdash;if not something nearer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That can't be, father,&rdquo; returned the girl, after a considerable pause; &ldquo;Hurry has had one father, and one mother; and people never have two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So much for your weak mind, Hetty. When Jude marries, her husband's father will be her father, and her husband's sister her sister. If she should marry Hurry, then he will be your brother.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
