When you've got through give us a call, and we'll all sit in council together touching the valie of the articles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop, Deerslayer,&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, as he was about to withdraw. &ldquo;Not a single thing will I touch&mdash;I will not even raise the lid&mdash;unless you are present. Father and Hetty have seen fit to keep the inside of this chest a secret from me, and I am much too proud to pry into their hidden treasures unless it were for their own good. But on no account will I open the chest alone. Stay with me, then; I want witnesses of what I do.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
