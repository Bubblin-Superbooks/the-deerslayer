<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Deerslayer, do you mean to marry Sumach, now she has neither husband nor brother to feed her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are such your idees of matrimony, Hetty! Ought the young to wive with the old&mdash;the pale-face with the red-skin&mdash;the Christian with the heathen? It's ag'in reason and natur', and so you'll see, if you think of it a moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I've always heard mother say,&rdquo; returned Hetty, averting her face more from a feminine instinct than from any consciousness of wrong, &ldquo;that people should never marry until they loved each other better than brothers and sisters, and I suppose that is what you mean. Sumach is old, and you are young!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
