<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There's no saying what young women may do, that's a truth, Hurry, and I suppose you're as likely to own the rifle as another. Still, when things are so very near perfection, it's a pity not to reach it entirely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&mdash;Would not that piece look as well on my shoulder, as on any man's?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As for looks, I say nothing. You are both good-looking, and might make what is called a good-looking couple. But the true p'int is as to conduct. More deer would fall in one day, by that piece, in some man's hands, than would fall in a week in your'n, Hurry! I've seen you try; yes, remember the buck t'other day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
