I think no more of a red-skin's scalp than I do of a pair of wolf's ears; and would just as lief finger money for the one as for the other. With white people 't is different, for they've a nat'ral avarsion to being scalped; whereas your Indian shaves his head in readiness for the knife, and leaves a lock of hair by way of braggadocio, that one can lay hold of in the bargain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's manly, however, and I felt from the first that we had only to get you on our side, to have your heart and hand,&rdquo; returned Tom, losing all his reserve, as he gained a renewed confidence in the disposition of his companions.</p></div> </div>
