That they have, I'll allow; but so has a fox, or even a bear. I'm older than you, and have lived longer in the woods&mdash;or, for that matter, have lived always there, and am not to be told what an Injin is or what he is not. If you wish to be considered a savage, you've only to say so, and I'll name you as such to Judith and the old man, and then we'll see how you'll like your welcome.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
