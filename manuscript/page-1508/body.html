<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;never mind, dear Hetty&mdash;&rdquo; interrupted Judith, sensitively alive to the preservation of her sister's secret, more, perhaps, at such a moment, than at any other. &ldquo;Hurry is well, and Deerslayer is well, and the Delaware is well, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How came they to shoot a poor girl like me, and let so many men go unharmed? I didn't know that the Hurons were so wicked, Judith!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;'Twas an accident, poor Hetty; a sad accident it has been! No one would willingly have injured you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I'm glad of that!&mdash;I thought it strange; I am feeble minded, and the redmen have never harmed me before. I should be sorry to think that they had changed their minds. I am glad too, Judith, that they haven't hurt Hurry. Deerslayer I don't think God will suffer any one to harm. It was very fortunate the soldiers came as they did though, for fire will burn!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
