<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was so curious to see if you could hit an eagle at so great a height, that I forgot altogether to speak, 'till the mischief was done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's it; that's just it, my good Hetty. We can all see our faults and mistakes when it's too late to help them! Howsever I'm glad you didn't speak, for I don't think a word or two would have stopped me, just at that moment, and so the sin stands in its nakedness, and not aggravated by any unheeded calls to forbear. Well, well, bitter thoughts are hard to be borne at all times, but there's times when they're harder than at others.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
