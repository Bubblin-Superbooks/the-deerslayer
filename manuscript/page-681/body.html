<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;One of my prisoners is a great warrior&mdash;tall as a pine&mdash;strong as the moose&mdash;active as a deer&mdash;fierce as the panther! Some day he'll be a great chief, and lead the army of King George!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tut-tut Mingo; Hurry Harry is Hurry Harry, and you'll never make more than a corporal of him, if you do that. He's tall enough, of a sartainty; but that's of no use, as he only hits his head ag'in the branches as he goes through the forest. He's strong too, but a strong body isn't a strong head, and the king's generals are not chosen for their sinews; he's swift, if you will, but a rifle bullet is swifter; and as for f'erceness, it's no great ricommend to a soldier; they that think they feel the stoutest often givin' out at the pinch.</p></div> </div>
