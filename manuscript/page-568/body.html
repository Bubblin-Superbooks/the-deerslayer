<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I hope you do not believe I can hesitate, when my father's life's in danger, Deerslayer!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, it's pretty much putting a scolding ag'in tears and mourning. It's not onreasonable to foretell that old Tom may find fault with what you've done, when he sees himself once more in his hut, here, but there's nothing unusual in men's falling out with what has been done for their own good; I dare to say that even the moon would seem a different thing from what it now does, could we look at it from the other side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Deerslayer, if we can find the key, I will authorize you to open the chest, and to take such things from it as you may think will buy father's ransom.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
