<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Lord, Judith, what a tongue you're mistress of! Speech and looks go hand in hand, like, and what one can't do, the other is pretty sartain to perform! Such a gal, in a month, might spoil the stoutest warrior in the colony.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And am I then so mistaken? Do you really love war, Deerslayer, better than the hearth, and the affections?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand your meaning, gal; yes, I do understand what you mean, I believe, though I don't think you altogether understand me. Warrior I may now call myself, I suppose, for I've both fou't and conquered, which is sufficient for the name; neither will I deny that I've feelin's for the callin', which is both manful and honorable when carried on accordin' to nat'ral gifts, but I've no relish for blood. Youth is youth, howsever, and a Mingo is a Mingo.</p></div> </div>
