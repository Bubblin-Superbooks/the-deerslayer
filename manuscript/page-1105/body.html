<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Judith you can't be in 'arnest!&rdquo; exclaimed Deerslayer, taken so much by surprise, as to betray more emotion than it was usual for him to manifest on ordinary occasions. &ldquo;Such a gift would be fit for a ra'al King to make; yes, and for a ra'al King to receive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never was more in earnest, in my life, Deerslayer, and I am as much in earnest in the wish as in the gift.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, gal, well; we'll find time to talk of this ag'in. You mustn't be down hearted, Hurry, for Judith is a sprightly young woman, and she has a quick reason; she knows that the credit of her father's rifle is safer in my hands, than it can possibly be in yourn; and, therefore, you mustn't be down hearted. In other matters, more to your liking, too, you'll find she'll give you the preference.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
