<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Welcome&mdash;welcome, Deerslayer!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, as the canoes floated at each other's side; &ldquo;we have had a melancholy&mdash;a frightful day&mdash;but your return is, at least, one misfortune the less! Have the Hurons become more human, and let you go; or have you escaped from the wretches, by your own courage and skill?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither, Judith&mdash;neither one nor t'other. The Mingos are Mingos still, and will live and die Mingos; it is not likely their natur's will ever undergo much improvement. Well! They've their gifts, and we've our'n, Judith, and it doesn't much become either to speak ill of what the Lord has created; though, if the truth must be said, I find it a sore trial to think kindly or to talk kindly of them vagabonds.</p></div> </div>
