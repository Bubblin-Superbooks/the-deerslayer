<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I thought it would get to this, Hetty, when you come to understand sarcumstances. 'Tis a moral impossibility that I should ever marry Sumach, and, though Injin weddin's have no priests and not much religion, a white man who knows his gifts and duties can't profit by that, and so make his escape at the fitting time. I do think death would be more nat'ral like, and welcome, than wedlock with this woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don't say it too loud,&rdquo; interrupted Hetty impatiently; &ldquo;I suppose she will not like to hear it. I'm sure Hurry would rather marry even me than suffer torments, though I am feeble minded; and I am sure it would kill me to think he'd prefer death to being my husband.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
