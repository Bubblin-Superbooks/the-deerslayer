<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Chin-gach-gook,&rdquo; pronouncing the name slowly, and dwelling on each syllable&mdash;&ldquo;Great Sarpent, Yengeese tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>[It is singular there should be any question concerning the origin of the well-known sobriquet of &ldquo;Yankees.&rdquo; Nearly all the old writers who speak of the Indians first known to the colonists make them pronounce the word &ldquo;English&rdquo; as &ldquo;Yengeese.&rdquo; Even at this day, it is a provincialism of New England to say &ldquo;Anglish&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Inglish,&rdquo; and there is a close conformity of sound between &ldquo;Anglish&rdquo; and &ldquo;yengeese,&rdquo; more especially if the latter word, as was probably the case, be pronounced short. The transition from &ldquo;Yengeese,&rdquo; thus pronounced, to &ldquo;Yankees&rdquo; is quite easy.</p></div> </div>
