<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Your gifts are for paint, and hawk's feathers, and blankets, and wampum, and mine are for doublets of skins, tough leggings, and sarviceable moccasins. I say moccasins, Judith, for though white, living as I do in the woods it's necessary to take to some of the practyces of the woods, for comfort's sake and cheapness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see no reason, Deerslayer, why one man may not wear a scarlet coat, as well as another,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;I wish I could see you in this handsome garment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See me in a coat fit for a Lord!&mdash;Well, Judith, if you wait till that day, you'll wait until you see me beyond reason and memory. No&mdash;no&mdash;gal, my gifts are my gifts, and I'll live and die in 'em, though I never bring down another deer, or spear another salmon. What have I done that you should wish to see me in such a flaunting coat, Judith?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
