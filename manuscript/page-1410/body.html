<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;good Sumach,&rdquo; interrupted Deerslayer, whose love of truth was too indomitable to listen to such hyperbole with patience, even though it came from the torn breast of a widow&mdash;&ldquo;Nay&mdash;nay, good Sumach, this is a little outdoing red-skin privileges.

This is nat'ral law, 'to do lest you should be done by.'&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
