<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Killer of the Deer,&rdquo; recommenced Rivenoak, certainly without any signs of sympathy or pity in his manner, though with calmness and dignity, &ldquo;Killer of the Deer, it is time that my people knew their minds. The sun is no longer over our heads; tired of waiting on the Hurons, he has begun to fall near the pines on this side of the valley. He is travelling fast towards the country of our French fathers; it is to warn his children that their lodges are empty, and that they ought to be at home. The roaming wolf has his den, and he goes to it when he wishes to see his young. The Iroquois are not poorer than the wolves. They have villages, and wigwams, and fields of corn; the Good Spirits will be tired of watching them alone. My people must go back and see to their own business.</p></div> </div>
