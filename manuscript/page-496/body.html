Now you love Hist, I know, Hetty, and so, among Injins, when love hardest never talk most.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's not the way among white people, who talk most about them they love best. I suppose it's because I'm only half-witted that I don't see the reason why it should be so different among red people.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
