Hurry Harry has a tongue, and, giant as he is, he talks more than he performs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;March is your fri'nd, Judith; and fri'nds should be tender of each other, when apart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all know what Hurry's friendship comes to! Let him have his own way in everything, and he's the best fellow in the colony; but 'head him off,' as you say of the deer, and he is master of everything near him but himself. Hurry is no favorite of mine, Deerslayer; and I dare say, if the truth was known, and his conversation about me repeated, it would be found that he thinks no better of me than I own I do of him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
