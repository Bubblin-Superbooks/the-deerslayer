It is certain that he did not see the color that crimsoned the whole of Judith's fine face, nor detect the uncontrollable distress that immediately after changed its hue to deadly paleness. A minute or two elapsed in profound stillness, the splash of the water seeming to occupy all the avenues of sound; and then Judith arose, and grasped the hand of the hunter, almost convulsively, with one of her own.</p><p>&ldquo;Deerslayer,&rdquo; she said, hurriedly, &ldquo;I'm glad the ice is broke between us. They say that sudden friendships lead to long enmities, but I do not believe it will turn out so with us. I know not how it is&mdash;but you are the first man I ever met, who did not seem to wish to flatter&mdash;to wish my ruin&mdash;to be an enemy in disguise&mdash;never mind; say nothing to Hurry, and another time we'll talk together again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
