Yes, I'd risk as much for you, at this moment, as I would risk in behalf of Hist, and that is sayin' as much as I can say of any darter of woman. I do not think I feel towards either&mdash;mind I say either, Judith&mdash;as if I wished to quit father and mother&mdash;if father and mother was livin', which, howsever, neither is&mdash;but if both was livin', I do not feel towards any woman as if I wish'd to quit 'em in order to cleave unto her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is enough!&rdquo; answered Judith, in a rebuked and smothered voice. &ldquo;I understand all that you mean. Marry you cannot with loving, and that love you do not feel for me.</p></div> </div>
