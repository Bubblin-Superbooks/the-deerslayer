<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Deerslayer has shown himself a boy, in going among the savages at this hour, and letting himself fall into their hands like a deer that tumbles into a pit,&rdquo; growled the old man, perceiving as usual the mote in his neighbor's eyes, while he overlooked the beam in his own; &ldquo;if he is left to pay for his stupidity with his own flesh, he can blame no one but himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's the way of the world, old Tom,&rdquo; returned Hurry. &ldquo;Every man must meet his own debts, and answer for his own sins. I'm amazed, howsever, that a lad as skilful and watchful as Deerslayer should have been caught in such a trap! Didn't he know any better than to go prowling about a Huron camp at midnight, with no place to retreat to but a lake?</p></div> </div>
