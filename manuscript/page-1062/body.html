Two girls would not be safe here, even should these Hurons fail in getting us into their power. Even father had as much as he could sometimes do, to keep peace upon the lake, and we should fail altogether. We must quit this spot, Hetty, and remove into the settlements.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry you think so, Judith,&rdquo; returned Hetty, dropping her head on her bosom, and looking thoughtfully down at the spot where the funeral pile of her mother could just be seen. &ldquo;I am very sorry to hear it. I would rather stay here, where, if I wasn't born, I've passed my life. I don't like the settlements&mdash;they are full of wickedness and heart burnings, while God dwells unoffended in these hills! I love the trees, and the mountains, and the lake, and the springs;</p></div> </div>
