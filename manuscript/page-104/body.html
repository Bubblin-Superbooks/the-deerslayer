<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All white men are not faultless, and therefore all Indians can't be faultless. And so your argument is out at the elbow in the start. But this is what I call reason. Here's three colors on 'arth: white, black, and red. White is the highest color, and therefore the best man; black comes next, and is put to live in the neighborhood of the white man, as tolerable, and fit to be made use of; and red comes last, which shows that those that made 'em never expected an Indian to be accounted as more than half human.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God made all three alike, Hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alike! Do you call a nigger like a white man, or me like an Indian?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
