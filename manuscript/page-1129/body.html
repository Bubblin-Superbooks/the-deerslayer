<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Still less for Mingo vagabonds,&rdquo; resumed Chingachgook, quite willingly complying with his friend's request. &ldquo;Tell the Huron dogs to howl louder, if they wish a Delaware to find them in the woods, where they burrow like foxes, instead of hunting like warriors. When they had a Delaware maiden in their camp, there was a reason for hunting them up; now they will be forgotten unless they make a noise. Chingachgook don't like the trouble of going to his villages for more warriors; he can strike their run-a-way trail; unless they hide it under ground, he will follow it to Canada alone. He will keep Wah-ta-Wah with him to cook his game; they two will be Delawares enough to scare all the Hurons back to their own country.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
