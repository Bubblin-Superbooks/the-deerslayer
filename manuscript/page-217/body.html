<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Hearken to reason, lad, and don't cry out afore you understand a case,&rdquo; returned the unmoved Hurry; &ldquo;the savages scalp your fri'nds, the Delawares, or Mohicans whichever they may be, among the rest; and why shouldn't we scalp? I will own, it would be ag'in right for you and me now, to go into the settlements and bring out scalps, but it's a very different matter as concerns Indians. A man shouldn't take scalps, if he isn't ready to be scalped, himself, on fitting occasions. One good turn desarves another, the world over. That's reason, and I believe it to be good religion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, Master Hurry,&rdquo; again interrupted the rich voice of Judith, &ldquo;is it religion to say that one bad turn deserves another?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
