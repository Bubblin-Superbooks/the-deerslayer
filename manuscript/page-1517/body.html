I thought then, if I could bury myself by the side of mother, I should be happier in the lake than in the hut.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;pardon me, dearest Hetty&mdash;on my bended knees, I beg you to pardon me, sweet sister, if any word, or act of mine drove you to so maddening and cruel a thought!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get up, Judith&mdash;kneel to God; don't kneel to me. Just so I felt when mother was dying! I remembered everything I had said and done to vex her, and could have kissed her feet for forgiveness.</p></div> </div>
