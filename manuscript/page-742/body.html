What would you wish to see in its place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should be a thousand times happier to live nearer to civilized beings&mdash;where there are farms and churches, and houses built as it might be by Christian hands; and where my sleep at night would be sweet and tranquil! A dwelling near one of the forts would be far better than this dreary place where we live!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, Judith, I can't agree too lightly in the truth of all this. If forts are good to keep off inimies, they sometimes hold inimies of their own. I don't think 'twould be for your good, or the good of Hetty, to live near one; and if I must say what I think, I'm afeard you are a little too near as it is.</p></div> </div>
