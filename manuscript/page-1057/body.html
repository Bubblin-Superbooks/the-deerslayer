That we had from his own mouth, and in his dying moments.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you glad, Judith, to find you had no father! He took care of us, and fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have done no more. I don't understand why he wasn't a father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear child, but let us do as you have said. It may be well to remain here, and let the Ark move a little away. Do you prepare the canoe, and I will tell Hurry and the Indians our wishes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
