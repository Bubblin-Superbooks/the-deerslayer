<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The Hurons shall not harm you, Deerslayer,&rdquo; cried the girl, much excited&mdash;&ldquo;'Tis wicked as well as cruel; I have the Bible, here, to tell them so. Do you think I would stand by and see you tormented?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hope not, my good Hetty, I hope not; and, therefore, when the moment comes, I expect you will move off, and not be a witness of what you can't help, while it would grieve you. But, I haven't stopped the paddles to talk of my own afflictions and difficulties, but to speak a little plainly to you, gal, consarnin' your own matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can you have to say to me, Deerslayer! Since mother died, few talk to me of such things.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
