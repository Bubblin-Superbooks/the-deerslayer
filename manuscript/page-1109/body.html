<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Harkee, Deerslayer,&rdquo; put in Hurry, a little authoritatively&mdash;&ldquo;You're a sensible man in a hunt, and as good a fellow on a march, as a sixty-miler-a-day could wish to meet with, but you're oncommon slow about messages; especially them that you think won't be likely to be well received. When a thing is to be told, why tell it; and don't hang back like a Yankee lawyer pretending he can't understand a Dutchman's English, just to get a double fee out of him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you, Hurry, and well are you named to-night, seeing you've no time to lose. But let us come at once to the p'int, seeing that's the object of this council&mdash;for council it may be called, though women have seats among us. The simple fact is this.</p></div> </div>
