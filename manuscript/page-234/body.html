But talk of other matters now, for you hardly understand these, poor Hetty. How do you like our new acquaintance, Deerslayer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He isn't handsome, father. Hurry is far handsomer than Deerslayer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's true; but they say he is a noted hunter! His fame had reached me before I ever saw him; and I did hope he would prove to be as stout a warrior as he is dexterous with the deer. All men are not alike, howsever, child; and it takes time, as I know by experience, to give a man a true wilderness heart.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
