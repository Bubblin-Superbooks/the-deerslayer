Let us talk of our poor mother&mdash;and of Thomas Hutter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak kindly then, sister, for you can't be quite certain that spirits don't both hear and see. If father wasn't father, he was good to us, and gave us food and shelter. We can't put any stones over their graves, here in the water, to tell people all this, and so we ought to say it with our tongues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They will care little for that, girl. 'Tis a great consolation to know, Hetty, that if mother ever did commit any heavy fault when young, she lived sincerely to repent of it; no doubt her sins were forgiven her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
