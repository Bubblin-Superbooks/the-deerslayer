That scalp business hasn't turned out at all profitable, and I've pretty much concluded to give it up; and to follow a less bloody calling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you got any scalp?

He talks like one that is getting tired of the business as well as myself. Why have you bound up his head? or, have the savages tomahawked him about the brains?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
