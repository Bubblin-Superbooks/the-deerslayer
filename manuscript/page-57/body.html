There's Tamenund, now, though a man so old that few remember when he was in his prime, Tamenund lets nothing escape his look, which is more like the scent of a hound than the sight of an eye. Then Uncas, the father of Chingachgook, and the lawful chief of the Mohicans, is another that it is almost hopeless to pass unseen. I'm improving, I will allow&mdash;I'm improving, but far from being perfect, as yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who is this Chingachgook, of whom you talk so much, Deerslayer!&rdquo; asked Hurry, as he moved off in the direction of the righted sapling; &ldquo;a loping red-skin, at the best, I make no question.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
