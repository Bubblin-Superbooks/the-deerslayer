<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I understand the natur' of sheep, though I've had but little to do with 'em, and the natur' of wolves too, and can take the idee of a wolf in the fleece of a sheep, though I think it would be like to prove a hot jacket for such a beast, in the warm months!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And sin and hypocrisy are hot jackets, as they will find who put them on,&rdquo; returned Hetty, positively, &ldquo;so the wolf would be no worse off than the sinner. Spirits don't hunt, nor trap, nor fish, nor do anything that vain men undertake, since they've none of the longings of this world to feed. Oh!
