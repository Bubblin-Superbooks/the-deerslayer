It will be recollected, however, that the trees and bushes here, as elsewhere, fairly overhung the water, making such a fringe to the lake, as to conceal any little variations from its general outline.</p><p>&ldquo;I've not been down at this end of the lake these two summers,&rdquo; said Hurry, standing up in the canoe, the better to look about him. &ldquo;Ay, there's the rock, showing its chin above the water, and I know that the river begins in its neighborhood.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
