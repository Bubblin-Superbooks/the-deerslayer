Father often opens it when you are away, though he don't in the least mind my being by, and seeing all he does, as well as hearing all he says.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is it that he does, and what does he say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell you, Judith,&rdquo; returned the other in a low but resolute voice. &ldquo;Father's secrets are not my secrets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Secrets! This is stranger still, Deerslayer, that father should tell them to Hetty, and not tell them to me!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
