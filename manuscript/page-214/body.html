<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;In which case, old Tom, why was their first salute an attempt to cut our throats?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don't know that their design was so bloody. It's natural and easy for an Indian to fall into ambushes and surprises; and, no doubt they wished to get on board the ark first, and to make their conditions afterwards. That a disapp'inted savage should fire at us, is in rule; and I think nothing of that. Besides, how often they burned me out, and robbed my traps&mdash;ay, and pulled trigger on me, in the most peaceful times?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The blackguards will do such things, I must allow; and we pay 'em off pretty much in their own c'ine. Women would not be on the war-path, sartainly; and, so far, there's reason in your idee.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
