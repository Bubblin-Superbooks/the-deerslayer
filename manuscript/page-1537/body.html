Is it not possible, think you, that the innocence of one of these beings may answer in the eyes of God for the salvation of both?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don't understand it so, Judith, though I'm no missionary, and am but poorly taught. Each spirit answers for its own backslidings, though a hearty repentance will satisfy God's laws.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then must my poor poor mother be in heaven! Bitterly, bitterly has she repented of her sins, and surely her sufferings in this life ought to count as something against her sufferings in the next!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All this goes beyond me, Judith. I strive to do right, here, as the surest means of keeping all right, hereafter. Hetty was oncommon, as all that know'd her must allow, and her soul was as fit to consart with angels the hour it left its body, as that of any saint in the Bible!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
