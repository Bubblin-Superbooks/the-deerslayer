As for Judith, old man, I enlist, at once, as her soldier, and here is Deerslayer to help you to take care of Hetty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Many thanks to you, Master March,&rdquo; returned the beauty, in a full, rich voice, and with an accuracy of intonation and utterance that she shared in common with her sister, and which showed that she had been better taught than her father's life and appearance would give reason to expect. &ldquo;Many thanks to you;</p></div> </div>
