<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Alway good to Wah!&mdash;too tender to twist hard; else she break.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and smile, too; you don't know how much a girl craves smiles from them she loves. Father scarce smiled on me once, while I was with him&mdash;and, Hurry&mdash;Yes&mdash;Hurry talked loud and laughed, but I don't think he smiled once either. You know the difference between a smile and a laugh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Laugh, best. Hear Wah laugh, think bird sing!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that; her laugh is pleasant, but you must smile. And then, Serpent, you mustn't make her carry burthens and hoe corn, as so many Indians do; but treat her more as the pale-faces treat their wives.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
