Bumppo isn't as pretty as Hutter, is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, that's as people fancy. Bumppo has no lofty sound, I admit; and yet men have bumped through the world with it. I did not go by this name, howsoever, very long; for the Delawares soon found out, or thought they found out, that I was not given to lying, and they called me, firstly, 'Straight-tongue.'&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That's a good name,&rdquo; interrupted Hetty, earnestly, and in a positive manner; &ldquo;don't tell me there's no virtue in names!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
