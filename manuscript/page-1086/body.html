<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Furlough!&mdash;That word has a meaning among the soldiers that I understand; but I cannot tell what it signifies when used by a prisoner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It means just the same. You're right enough; the soldiers do use it, and just in the same way as I use it. A furlough is when a man has leave to quit a camp or a garrison for a sartain specified time; at the end of which he is to come back and shoulder his musket, or submit to his torments, just as he may happen to be a soldier, or a captyve. Being the last, I must take the chances of a prisoner.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
