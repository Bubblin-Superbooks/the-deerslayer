<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;May I depend on you to stand by me and my daughters, then, Deerslayer?&rdquo; demanded the old man, with a father's anxiety in his countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;That may you, Floating Tom, if that's your name; and as a brother would stand by a sister, a husband his wife, or a suitor his sweetheart. In this strait you may count on me, through all advarsities; and I think Hurry does discredit to his natur' and wishes, if you can't count on him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; cried Judith, thrusting her handsome face out of the door; &ldquo;his nature is hurry, as well as his name, and he'll hurry off, as soon as he thinks his fine figure in danger. Neither 'old Tom,' nor his 'gals,' will depend much on Master March, now they know him, but you they will rely on, Deerslayer; for your honest face and honest heart tell us that what you promise you will perform.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
