<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;At a small round rock, near the foot of the lake, where they tell me, the tribes are given to resorting to make their treaties, and to bury their hatchets. This rock have I often heard the Delawares mention, though lake and rock are equally strangers to me. The country is claimed by both Mingos and Mohicans, and is a sort of common territory to fish and hunt through, in time of peace, though what it may become in war-time, the Lord only knows!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Common territory&rdquo; exclaimed Hurry, laughing aloud. &ldquo;I should like to know what Floating Tom Hutter would say to that! He claims the lake as his own property, in vartue of fifteen years' possession, and will not be likely to give it up to either Mingo or Delaware without a battle for it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
