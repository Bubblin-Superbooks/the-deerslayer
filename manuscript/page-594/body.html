<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Then you think, Deerslayer, that Thomas Hutter has no one in his family&mdash;no child&mdash;no daughter, to whom this dress may be thought becoming, and whom you could wish to see in it, once and awhile, even though it should be at long intervals, and only in playfulness?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand you, Judith&mdash;yes, I now understand your meaning, and I think I can say, your wishes. That you are as glorious in that dress as the sun when it rises or sets in a soft October day, I'm ready to allow, and that you greatly become it is a good deal more sartain than that it becomes you. There's gifts in clothes, as well as in other things. Now I do not think that a warrior on his first path ought to lay on the same awful paints as a chief that has had his virtue tried, and knows from exper'ence he will not disgrace his pretensions. So it is with all of us, red or white.</p></div> </div>
