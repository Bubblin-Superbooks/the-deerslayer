<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I, Tom Warley, turn Benedict! Faith, my dear boy, you little know the corps you speak of, if you fancy any such thing. I do suppose there are women in the colonies that a captain of Light Infantry need not disdain; but they are not to be found up here, on a mountain lake; or even down on the Dutch river where we are posted. It is true, my uncle, the general, once did me the favor to choose a wife for me in Yorkshire; but she had no beauty&mdash;and I would not marry a princess, unless she were handsome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If handsome, you would marry a beggar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, these are the notions of an ensign! Love in a cottage&mdash;doors&mdash;and windows&mdash;the old story, for the hundredth time. The 20th&mdash;don't marry. We are not a marrying corps, my dear boy.</p></div> </div>
