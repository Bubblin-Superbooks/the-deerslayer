<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This is strange, Judith!&mdash;I didn't think the earth held a handsomer, or a stronger, or a more active or a braver man than Hurry Harry! I'm sure I never met his equal in either of these things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, Hetty&mdash;say no more of this. I dislike to hear you talking in this manner. 'Tis not suitable to your innocence, and truth, and warm-hearted sincerity. Let Harry March go. He quits us to-night, and no regret of mine will follow him, unless it be that he has staid so long, and to so little purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Judith; that is what I've long feared&mdash;and I did so hope he might be my brother-in-law!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
