<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;That's not it, father! I heard Deerslayer say how it was. You must do to your enemies as you wish your enemies would do to you. No man wishes his enemies to kill him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We kill our enemies in war, girl, lest they should kill us. One side or the other must begin; and them that begin first, are most apt to get the victory. You know nothing about these things, poor Hetty, and had best say nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Judith says it is wrong, father; and Judith has sense though I have none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jude understands better than to talk to me of these matters; for she has sense, as you say, and knows I'll not bear it. Which would you prefer, Hetty; to have your own scalp taken, and sold to the French, or that we should kill our enemies, and keep them from harming us?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
