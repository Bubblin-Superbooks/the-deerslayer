<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;This must be the place, Deerslayer,&rdquo; March at length observed; &ldquo;here is a beech by the side of a hemlock, with three pines at hand, and yonder is a white birch with a broken top; and yet I see no rock, nor any of the branches bent down, as I told you would be the case.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Broken branches are onskilful landmarks, as the least exper'enced know that branches don't often break of themselves,&rdquo; returned the other; &ldquo;and they also lead to suspicion and discoveries. The Delawares never trust to broken branches, unless it is in friendly times, and on an open trail. As for the beeches, and pines, and hemlocks, why, they are to be seen on all sides of us, not only by twos and threes, but by forties, and fifties, and hundreds.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
