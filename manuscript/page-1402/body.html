It will be a sorrowful whoop; when it is understood, grief will come after it. There will be one scalp-whoop, but there will be only one. We have the fur of the Muskrat; his body is among the fishes. Deerslayer must say whether another scalp shall be on our pole. Two lodges are empty; a scalp, living or dead, is wanted at each door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then take 'em dead, Huron,&rdquo; firmly, but altogether without dramatic boasting, returned the captive. &ldquo;My hour is come, I do suppose, and what must be, must. If you are bent on the tortur', I'll do my indivours to bear up ag'in it, though no man can say how far his natur' will stand pain, until he's been tried.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
