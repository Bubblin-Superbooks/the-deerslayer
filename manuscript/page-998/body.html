<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Has any thing happened to father?&rdquo; demanded Judith, as her foot touched the platform; speaking quickly, for her nerves were in a state to be easily alarmed.</p><p>Hetty seemed concerned, and she looked furtively about her as if unwilling any one but a child should hear what she had to communicate, and even that she should learn it abruptly.</p><p>&ldquo;You know how it is with father sometimes, Judith,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;When overtaken with liquor he doesn't always know what he says or does, and he seems to be overtaken with liquor now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is strange! Would the savages have drunk with him, and then leave him behind? But 'tis a grievous sight to a child, Hetty, to witness such a failing in a parent, and we will not go near him 'til he wakes.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
