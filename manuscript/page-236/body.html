It's no advantage, Hetty, to be so marked for anything as to become an object of envy, or to be sought after more than others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother was good, if she was handsome,&rdquo; returned the girl, the tears starting to her eyes, as usually happened when she adverted to her deceased parent.</p><p>Old Hutter, if not equally affected, was moody and silent at this allusion to his wife. He continued smoking, without appearing disposed to make any answer, until his simple-minded daughter repeated her remark, in a way to show that she felt uneasiness lest he might be inclined to deny her assertion. Then he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and laying his hand in a sort of rough kindness on the girl's head, he made a reply.</p></div> </div>
