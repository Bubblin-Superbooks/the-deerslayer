<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What did the Delawares say of the hussy? for an Indian, after all, has his notions of woman-kind, as well as a white man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They said she was fair to look on, and pleasant of speech; but over-given to admirers, and light-minded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are devils incarnate! After all, what schoolmaster is a match for an Indian, in looking into natur'! Some people think they are only good on a trail or the war-path, but I say that they are philosophers, and understand a man as well as they understand a beaver, and a woman as well as they understand either. Now that's Judith's character to a ribbon! To own the truth to you, Deerslayer, I should have married the gal two years since, if it had not been for two particular things, one of which was this very lightmindedness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
