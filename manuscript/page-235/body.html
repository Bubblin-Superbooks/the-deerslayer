<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have I got a wilderness heart, father&mdash;and Hurry, is his heart true wilderness?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sometimes ask queer questions, Hetty! Your heart is good, child, and fitter for the settlements than for the woods; while your reason is fitter for the woods than for the settlements.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why has Judith more reason than I, father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heaven help thee, child: this is more than I can answer. God gives sense, and appearance, and all these things; and he grants them as he seeth fit. Dost thou wish for more sense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not I. The little I have troubles me; for when I think the hardest, then I feel the unhappiest. I don't believe thinking is good for me, though I do wish I was as handsome as Judith!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
